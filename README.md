# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the ratio of retiring employees that can fulfill the responsibility of mentoring the future generation of employees at Pewlett_Hackard.  All employees have been organized based on the departments and roles within the company.  It is important to the future success of the company that the resources contained within the humans that work there are preserved and passed along.

## Results

- We organized a schema for the desired information and how it would     be organized based upon the required connections to determine how     our mentorship program would function.
- By using the Entity Relationship Diagram we can effectively see how   the data interacts and build it accordingly.
- We isolated the year of birth that represents the next wave of         retiring employees to the tune of 90,308. Which is approximately       ~37% of the workforce.  It is immperative that Hewlett Packard         identifies the talent that they will be losing and moves quickly to   train new individuals.
- The number of people that are eligible for the mentorship program as   determined by our analysis is 1549 individuals. The best course of action based on these determinations is to create teams of approximately 59 people to be lead by a retiring professional within their department to create workflows and training protocols in order to maintain the existing level of productivity. these groups can be made smaller by spreading out the traing over 3 years resulting in more manageable teams of 20 people.

## Summary

We were able to determine the scope of what lies ahead for Pewlett Hackard and can utilize this information to develop effective strategies.  We will need to determine the number of engineers who are not retiring as well as the senior staff positions that will need to be filled and identify internally if the current workforce has the capacity for this type of promotion.  We can build additional queries between the available data to identify the companies ability to promote from within and also to use in hiring campaigns to attract the appropriate talent.
